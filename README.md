# Overview

This repository features an analysis of the usage of designated language translation services by Toronto Paramedic Servicesâ€™ Emergency Medical Dispatchers during 911 calls from 2014 to 2021. This data was pulled from the City of Toronto Open Portal. In my investigation, I chose the top ten languages that had the highest cumulative call duration using language services. I found that there is a surprising contradiction between the top three languages with the highest call duration and the top three most spoken home languages according to the 2021 Toronto Census.

abstract: "Toronto is known for its multiculturalism, with ethnically diverse communities spread throughout the city. One implication of such a large immigrant population is the variety of non-English first languages being used. This report aims to investigate the usage of designated language translation services by Toronto Paramedic Servicesâ€™ Emergency Medical Dispatchers during 9-1-1 calls from 2014 to 2021. By analyzing this data, we can evaluate which groups require more accessibility to specific language services during emergency situations so that the city can more efficiently help those in need."
